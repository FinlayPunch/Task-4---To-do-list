<h1>Connections for Python</h1>

<b1>By Finlay Punch</b1><br><br>

<b2>This is a version of the New York Times game <b>Connections</b> made expressly for use in the Python terminal. It was made by me over the course of 2 months for my Task 1 assessment for Year 11 Software Engineering.

<h1>How to play</h1>

<b1>Connections for Python functions in the same way as the base Connections on the New York Times website.</b1><br><br>

<b2>
1. <b>16 words</b> are randomly generated and placed in a <b>4x4 grid</b>, they are divided into <b>four hidden categories</b>.<br><br>
2. One must figure out the <b>connections</b> between the words and group them into <b>sets of four</b>; grouped words become a category.<br><br>
3. The user can enter their four guesses into the <b>terminal</b>, the program will determine whether they are right or wrong.<br><br>
4. You have <b>four chances</b> to group words into categories.<br><br>
5. If <b>all four guesses</b> are correct then you win.<br><br>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<b1>
1. A player only has <b>four attempts</b> to guess all four connections, if they run out of attempts, <b>they lose</b>.<br><br>
2. Guesses must be entered <b>into the terminal</b> with <b>one space between them</b>, capitalisation <b>each word needs to be capitalised</b>.<br><br>
3. If the guess is incomplete <b>(i.e. the player only entered 3 guesses)</b> the program will notify the player to enter in a <b>full set of four</b>.<br><br>
4. If there are <b>four words</b> in the guess, but the words are from <b>different categories</b>, are <b>different words</b> entirely, are <b>not words</b>, or are <b>misspelt</b>, the game will treat the guess as wrong and notify the player of such.<br><br>
5. If the player has <b>more than zero</b> attempts left, and they have gotten <b>all four</b> connections right, they win.<br><br>
</b1>

<h1>How to set it up</h1>

<b1>
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/FinlayPunch/Connections-Asessment.git<br><br>
2. Navigate to whether you cloned the repository and open it in the IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code perhaps).<br><br>
3. Open the file in it called <b>Main Line.py</b>. All other files are archaic and served specific purposes early in development.<br><br>
4. Run the file and play.<br><br>
