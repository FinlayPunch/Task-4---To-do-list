<h1>My task manager</h1>

<b1>By Finlay Punch</b1><br><br>

<b2>This is the task manager that I made for my Task 4 assessment for St Augustines students.
</b2>


<h1>Utilisation</h1>

<b1>My program allows for the user to easily create a to-do list of tasks.</b1><br><br>

<b2>
From the index page, one can log into an existing account, or sign up..<br><br>
Once in the dashboard, the user can create many tasks within the overall task list.<br><br>
These tasks consist of a title, description, category (sport, misc, school), and date.<br><br>
You can check the tasks as completed once you have completed them<br><br>
You are a able to edit or delete these tasks at any time.<br><br>
</b2>

<h1>How to set it up</h1>

<b1>
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/FinlayPunch/Task-4---To-do-list.git<br><br>
2. Navigate to whether you cloned the repository and open it in the IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code perhaps).<br><br>
3. Open the file in it called <b>app.py</b>.<br><br>
4. Run the file and wait for the web address to appear in the terminal. Paste the link into your browser.<br><br>
5. The database is created at the same time as the website.
