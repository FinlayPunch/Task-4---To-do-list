<h1>Utilisation</h1>

<b1>My program allows for the user to easily create a to-do list of tasks.</b1><br><br>

<b2>
From the index page, one can log into an existing account, or sign up..<br><br>
Once in the dashboard, the user can create many tasks within the overall task list.<br><br>
These tasks consist of a title, description, category (sport, misc, school), and date.<br><br>
You can check the tasks as completed once you have completed them<br><br>
You are a able to edit or delete these tasks at any time.<br><br>
</b2>
